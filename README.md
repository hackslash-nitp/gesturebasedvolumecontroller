### This is an implementation of computer vision library "opencv" to make a gesture based volume controller which detects the hand landmarks using "mediapipe" library.

The index and thumb are used to set the scale and by their movement we alter the volume level.
The pinky is used to set the desired volume by being raised or bent.

Below is a working demo:-
